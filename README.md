## What is The Forge Flow?

The Forge Flow (`tff`) is a Claude Code plugin that orchestrates AI agents through a structured software development lifecycle. It coordinates 4 lean agents and 18 skills from project initialization to shipped code.

**Key features:**
- **SQLite state** — zero-dependency local state management with automatic persistence
- **Wave-based execution** -- tasks are topologically sorted into waves, independent tasks run in parallel
- **Fresh reviewer enforcement** -- code reviewers are never the same agent that wrote the code
- **Plannotator integration** -- all plan reviews, verification, and code reviews go through plannotator's interactive UI
- **Complexity tiers** -- S (quick fix), F-lite (feature), F-full (complex) determine which phases are required
- **Checkpoint/resumability** -- pause and resume execution across sessions
- **Skill library** -- 18 reusable methodology skills that agents load for consistent practices
- **Autonomous flow** -- `plan-to-pr` mode auto-runs from plan approval through PR creation, with escalation on failure
- **Auto-learn pipeline** -- observes tool-use patterns, ranks candidates, drafts skills with bounded guardrails
- **Lean agents** -- 4 identity-only agents for fresh-reviewer enforcement; all methodology lives in skills

## Setup Guide

The Forge Flow requires **Node.js 20+** and **Git**. Optionally install **plannotator** for interactive review UI.

### Step 1: Install plannotator

Plannotator is a Claude Code plugin that provides an interactive browser UI for reviewing plans and code.

```bash
# Add the plannotator marketplace
claude /plugin marketplace add backnotprop/plannotator

# Install the plugin
claude /plugin install plannotator@plannotator
```

Verify: Run `/plannotator-review` in Claude Code -- it should open a browser window.

### Step 2: Install The Forge Flow

```bash
# Add the marketplace
claude /plugin marketplace add MonsieurBarti/The-Forge-Flow-CC-Test

# Install the plugin
claude /plugin install tff-test@the-forge-flow-test
```

Verify: Run `/tff-test:help` in Claude Code to see the command reference.

### Verification

Run `/tff-test:health` to check state consistency and plannotator availability.

## Full Workflow Example

Here's a complete walkthrough from empty project to shipped milestone: building an authentication system.

### 1. Initialize the project

```
/tff-test:new
```

Claude asks for your project name and vision. You provide:
- **Name:** my-saas-app
- **Vision:** A multi-tenant SaaS platform with team management

This creates `.tff/PROJECT.md` and asks you to define requirements.

**Next step suggested:** `/tff-test:new-milestone`

### 2. Create a milestone

```
/tff-test:new-milestone
```

- **Name:** MVP
- **Goal:** Basic auth + team CRUD

This creates the `milestone/M01` branch and prompts you to break the milestone into slices.

You define 3 slices:
1. **Auth flow** -- signup, login, JWT tokens
2. **Team CRUD** -- create/read/update/delete teams
3. **Permissions** -- role-based access control

**Next step suggested:** `/tff-test:discuss`

### 3. Discuss the first slice

```
/tff-test:discuss
```

The **brainstormer** agent (opus) challenges your assumptions:
- "What OAuth providers do you need? Just email/password?"
- "How do JWT tokens refresh? What's the expiry strategy?"
- "Is email verification required for MVP?"

The **product-lead** agent validates requirements and defines acceptance criteria.

Complexity is auto-classified as **F-lite** (5 tasks, 2 modules, no external integrations).

**Next step suggested:** `/tff-test:research M01-S01`

### 4. Research (optional for F-lite)

```
/tff-test:research M01-S01
```

The agent investigates the technical approach: reads the existing codebase, checks what auth libraries are available, documents findings in `.tff/milestones/M01/slices/M01-S01/RESEARCH.md`.

**Next step suggested:** `/tff-test:plan M01-S01`

### 5. Plan the slice

```
/tff-test:plan M01-S01
```

The agent creates a task decomposition with dependencies:
- T01: User entity + migration (no deps)
- T02: Password hashing service (no deps)
- T03: Signup endpoint (depends on T01, T02)
- T04: Login endpoint (depends on T01, T02)
- T05: JWT middleware (depends on T04)

Waves detected:
- Wave 0: [T01, T02] -- parallel
- Wave 1: [T03, T04] -- parallel
- Wave 2: [T05] -- sequential

**Plannotator opens** in your browser. You annotate the plan, suggest changes, approve.

A worktree is created at `.tff/worktrees/M01-S01/` on branch `slice/M01-S01`.

**Next step suggested:** `/tff-test:execute M01-S01`

### 6. Execute with wave parallelism

```
/tff-test:execute M01-S01
```

For each wave:

**Wave 0:** The **tester** agent writes failing specs for T01 and T02. Then **backend-dev** agents are spawned in parallel -- one for T01 (user entity), one for T02 (password hashing). Each implements until tests pass, then commits atomically.

**Wave 1:** Same pattern for T03 and T04. Tests written first, then implementation.

**Wave 2:** T05 (JWT middleware) -- sequential, single agent.

Checkpoints are saved after each wave. If the session crashes, `/tff-test:resume` picks up where it left off.

**Next step suggested:** `/tff-test:verify M01-S01`

### 7. Verify acceptance criteria

```
/tff-test:verify M01-S01
```

The **product-lead** agent checks each acceptance criterion against the implementation. Results are written to `VERIFICATION.md`.

**Plannotator opens** for you to review the findings. You mark any issues.

If all pass: **Next step suggested:** `/tff-test:ship M01-S01`
If failures: suggests `/tff-test:execute M01-S01` to fix and re-run.

### 8. Ship the slice (two-stage review)

```
/tff-test:ship M01-S01
```

**Stage 1 -- Spec compliance:** The **spec-reviewer** agent (fresh, never wrote this code) verifies every acceptance criterion is met in the actual code.

**Stage 2 -- Code quality:** The **code-reviewer** agent checks quality, patterns, tests, YAGNI. Only runs after spec passes.

**Security audit:** The **security-auditor** agent checks for OWASP top 10 issues.

**Plannotator opens** for your final code review.

If approved: slice PR is created (`slice/M01-S01` -> `milestone/M01`), merged, worktree cleaned up.

**Next step suggested:** `/tff-test:discuss` (for the next slice) or `/tff-test:progress`

### 9. Repeat for remaining slices

Run the same cycle for M01-S02 (Team CRUD) and M01-S03 (Permissions).

### 10. Complete the milestone

```
/tff-test:audit-milestone
```

Checks all slices are closed, requirements are covered. Then:

```
/tff-test:complete-milestone
```

Creates the milestone PR (`milestone/M01` -> `main`), runs a final security audit, opens plannotator for review. After approval, merges to main.

**Next step suggested:** `/tff-test:new-milestone` for the next milestone.

### Quick fixes and debugging

Found a bug while working on a later slice? Two options:

**If you know the fix:**
```
/tff-test:quick "Fix null pointer in user validation"
```
Skips brainstorming and research, goes straight to plan -> execute -> ship.

**If you need to investigate:**
```
/tff-test:debug "Users getting 500 on login after password reset"
```
Systematically diagnoses the issue first (no slice created), then fixes via S-tier slice once root cause is confirmed.

    dist/tff-tools.cjs    # Compiled single-file CLI bundle
```

### Hexagonal Rules

- **Domain** imports only Zod + `node:crypto`. No infrastructure.
- **Zod as single source of truth** -- `z.infer<typeof Schema>` everywhere, no TS `enum`.
- **Result\<T, E\>** for all fallible operations. Never throw.
- **Ports** define interfaces in domain. Adapters implement in infrastructure.
- **Tests** colocated as `.spec.ts`. Unit tests use in-memory adapters.

## Agents

After v0.7.0's skills architecture reform, methodology moved from agents to skills. Only 4 identity-only agents remain -- they exist for fresh-reviewer enforcement (ensuring the reviewer is never the same agent that wrote the code).

| Agent | Role | Profile |
|---|---|---|
| code-reviewer | Code quality review (fresh reviewer) | quality (opus) |
| spec-reviewer | Spec compliance verification | quality (opus) |
| security-auditor | Security review on every PR | quality (opus) |
| fixer | Apply accepted review findings | budget (sonnet) |

## Skills

Skills are reusable knowledge fragments loaded via `@skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. They teach HOW to do something -- agents define WHO does it. After v0.7.0, all methodology lives in skills (decoupled from TFF-specific terminology).

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| hexagonal-architecture | DDD + CQRS + hexagonal boundary patterns |
| test-driven-development | TDD methodology with HARD-GATE enforcement |
| code-review-protocol | Two-stage review (spec compliance + code quality) |
| commit-conventions | Conventional commit format and rules |
| plannotator-usage | Interactive plan/review UI integration |
| brainstorming | Structured discovery and design exploration |
| systematic-debugging | 4-phase investigation (Track A/B diagnosis) |
| writing-plans | Break specs into bite-sized tasks (2-5 min each) |
| executing-plans | Wave-based execution with fresh subagent per task |
| finishing-work | Pre-PR checklist, structured merge/PR decision |
| stress-testing-specs | Devil's advocate for assumptions and scope |
| architecture-review | C4 model, dependency inversion review |
| acceptance-criteria-validation | Binary verdict per criterion, evidence-based |
| codebase-documentation | Divio framework documentation generation |
| skill-authoring | Evidence-driven pattern analysis for new skills |
| agent-authoring | Standardized agent template (identity-only) |
| receiving-code-review | Technical rigor when processing review feedback |
| verification-before-completion | Evidence before claims, always |

## Work Hierarchy

```
Project (one per repo)
  Milestone (M01, M02, ...)
    Slice (M01-S01, M01-S02, ...)
      Task (T01, T02, ...)
```

### Git Branch Model

```
main
  milestone/M01
    slice/M01-S01  (worktree)
    slice/M01-S02  (worktree)
```

### Complexity Tiers

| Tier | Brainstormer | Research | TDD | Fresh Reviewer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S (quick fix) | Skip | Skip | Skip | Always |
| F-lite (feature) | Yes | Optional | Yes | Always |
| F-full (complex) | Yes | Required | Yes | Always |

## Configuration

Project settings live in `.tff/settings.yaml`. Generated automatically by `/tff-test:new` with inline comments. Manage interactively with `/tff-test:settings`.

```yaml
model-profiles:
  quality:
    model: opus       # brainstormer, architect, code-reviewer, security-auditor
  balanced:
    model: sonnet     # product-lead, tester
  budget:
    model: sonnet     # frontend-dev, backend-dev, devops, fixer, doc-writer

autonomy:
  mode: guided        # "guided" (pause at every step) | "plan-to-pr" (auto-transition)

auto-learn:
  weights:
    frequency: 0.25
    breadth: 0.30
    recency: 0.25
    consistency: 0.20
  guardrails:
    min-corrections: 3
    cooldown-days: 7
    max-drift-pct: 20
  clustering:
    min-sessions: 3
    min-patterns: 2

```

Settings are resilient: corrupted or partial files fall back to defaults per field. Run `/tff-test:settings` to detect and add missing fields.
